    Search results HTML
        
    *   The "top" search results item seems to be consistently duplicated
        in the "more" results area.
        
    *   Fuzzy results would be nice where a search term has zero direct
        matches. For example, search for "memornada" and get no results.
        
    *   More than the content of the articles are being indexed, which is
        incorrect. For example, search for "rural" and see the site map
        appear as the most relevant result.
